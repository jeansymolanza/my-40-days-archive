# My 40 Days

This archival repository contains the original My 40 Days website. It was originally a Wordpress blog, but I have since migrated the code to Next.js to make it compatible with the vast majority of static content hosting platforms.

Caleb started My 40 Days as a way of challenging himself to overcome the fear of failure. The idea was take on challenges that propel him way outside of his comfort zone; usually things with a high risk of failure that could possibly leave him drowning in a pit of social awkwardness. People would submit these challenges to him via Facebook or Twitter. 

We worked together on getting the Wordpress blog set up and subsequently hosted it on a shared server I owned. Following the decomissioning of that shared server, I have decided to migrate the website to a location where it can be easily accessed by all.

Caleb went to be with our Lord earlier this year (2020). In honour of his memory and his efforts around My 40 Days, I have put together this repository to celebrate his accomplishments with the project.
